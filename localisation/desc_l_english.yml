POLITICS_MANUEL_AZANA_DESC:0 "Having already served as the republic's second Prime Minister, Manuel Azaña Díaz has once again managed to secure a new term as Spain's head of government, albeit by a slim margin and only through the unified front of the country's left-wing parties. His policies enacted during his first term left him largely unpopular with the right, having reduced the power and influence of the Roman Catholic Church and discriminating against monarchists. His previous administration has proven to be ineffective to say the least, but after his short withdrawal from politics, Azaña managed to unite the country's left-wing republicans, communists, and anarchists under a single front. At least for now."
